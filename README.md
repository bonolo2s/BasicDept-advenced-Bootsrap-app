## Description
This project is a comprehensive clone of a basic/dept store application, enhanced with advanced features.

##Motivation
I wanted to explore the features Bootstrap 5 has to offer, from simple elements like footers and navigation bars to advanced off-canvas features.
This project strengthened my frontend application skills and helped me leverage Bootstrap to its full capacity.
Now, I understand why many freelance developers prefer it - its speed and efficiency are crucial factors in business.
This experience has fueled my motivation to continue learning and improving
